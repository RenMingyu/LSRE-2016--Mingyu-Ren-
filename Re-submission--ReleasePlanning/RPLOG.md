Launch this assignment. Start working on release planning. Download the description of release planning assignment and all the 208 requirements.

##### 2017/1/19
Read and understand the assignment description deeply. Then, read all of the following 208 requirements.

##### 2017/1/20
In order to deeply understand all the 208 requirements, we document these 208 requirements in an excel table. And analysis them based on the course discussion forum from different viewpoints. 

##### 2017/1/21
Base on the analysis from different viewpoints to divide 208 requirements into several different types.

##### 2017/1/22
Search methods for requirement prioritization. In order to achieve this goal, we need to check the prioritization methods in course discussion forum and search some relative articles about these methods.

##### 2017/1/22
Sort out the methods that we have found. 
Finding: 1. Simple ranking 2. MoSCoW method 3. AHP method 4. Hundred dollar method 5. Software value map method 6. Kano method 7. Planning game method 8. Value-oriented prioritization method.

##### 2017/1/23-2017/1/26
Read relative articles about these methods. The articles we need to read:

##### 2017/1/27
Search methods for release planning. In order to achieve this goal, we need to check the release planning method in course discussion forum and search some relative articles about these methods.

##### 2017/1/28
Sort out the methods that we have found. 
Finding: 1. Hybird release planning method 2. EVOLVE method 3. Risk-driven method 4. Theme-based product release planning method 5. A feature partitioning method for distributed agile release planning.

##### 2017/2/02
Communicate with other students in this course. To select one prioritization method and one release planning method to complete our release planning.

##### 2017/2/03
Make sure the two methods.
We decided to use MoScoW method and theme-based release planning method to complete our own project.

##### 2017/2/04
Use MoScoW method prioritize the requirements, result showed in report.

##### 2017/2/04
Use theme-based release planning method to tap hidden business opportunities by releasing highly interdependent features together, result showed in report.

##### 2017/2/05
Start to write report.

##### 2017/2/05-2017/2/09
Still working on the report.

##### 2017/2/10
Finished the report. Log end.
