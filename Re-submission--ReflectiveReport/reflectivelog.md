Launch the assignment, Log start, download the assignment description document, read and understand it.

#### 2/11/2017
Start to search some relevant literatures about the techniques that in the requirement prioritization or requirement release plan domain.
Following are the main reading list:

#### 2/11/2017-2/15/2017
Read and deep understand these 10 articles. 

#### 2/16/2017
Decide to use two articles to learn their methods/techniques. Understand and do the implementation planning for the both methods.
The two articles are:
[1] Hatton S. Choosing the right prioritisation method[C]//Software Engineering, 2008. ASWEC 2008. 19th Australian Conference on. IEEE, 2008: 517-526.
[2] Carlshamre P, Sandahl K, Lindvall M, et al. An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software product release planning[C]//Requirements Engineering, 2001. Proceedings. Fifth IEEE International Symposium on. IEEE, 2001: 84-91.
The articles name:
1. Choosing the right prioritisation method.
2. An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software product release planning.

#### 2/17/2017
Read these two articles again. Try to use interdependencies in requirements method and MoSCoW method to complete our plan.

#### 2/18/2017-2/19/2017
Start to implement interdependencies in requirements method.
Document the result of interdependencies in requirements method into report.

#### 2/20/2017-2/21/2017
Start to implement MoSCoW method.
Document the result of MoSCoW method into report.

#### 2/22/2017-2/25/2017
Write the lesson learned from the implementation and find some other references about the LSRE and some comments about the techniques.

#### 2/26/2017-2/27/2017
Read the articles again, and write the reflection.

#### 2/27/2017
Finish the report and log end.
