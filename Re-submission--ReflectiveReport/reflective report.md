### Article 1: “Choosing the right prioritization method”

#### Motivation for selection:
This article is valuable in the software requirement engineering domain. In this article, the author mentions requirements prioritization is a vital step in the software development process. Prioritization has many benefits, such as reducing the risk. Then the author mentions four main method for requirements prioritization. They are simple ranking method, MoSCoW method, AHP method and hundred-dollar method. The author not only describes the principle of each method, but also show the advantages and disadvantages of each method. From this article, I can learn lots of method for requirements prioritization. So, I selected this article.

##### Implementation plan:
Because there are four methods has been introduced from this paper. I will select a suitable method for my technique. This method is MoSCoW method. We will follow several steps to use this method. At first, we classified the requirements into different types. Then according to the stakeholders’ opinion and our own experience, we will classify these 208 requirements into 4 different levels. They are Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won’t Have. When we do release planning, we will first focus on the Must have level requirements, then focus on the should have level requirements, next we will focus on the could have level requirements, at last, we will focus on the won’t have level requirements.

#####   Execution 

Because of the requirements have already been divided into 11 different types. So in this assignment, at first, we only need to find out all the must have level requirements from all the different types. Then we need to find out all the should have level requirements from all the different types. Next, we need to find out all the could have level requirements from all the different types. At last, we need to find out all the won’t have level requirements from all the different types. When we do the release planning, we will do the follow the order of Must->Should->Could->Won't.

##### Proof of Concept

##### Lesson Learned:
For this project, there are 208 requirements. As we know that, more than 1000 requirements are large scale requirements. 208 requirements are not belonging to LSRE, but it is also a difficult thing for us to dealing with these requirements. MoSCoW method is a good method for requirements prioritization. It also can help us understand the requirements. From learning this article, I find there are many benefits of MoSCoW method, such as quick and easy to learn, easy to handle and so on.

##### Reflection:
There are some other articles that in favor of using MoSCoW method in requirement prioritization. Such as article [3][4], they all propose to use MoSCoW method for prioritizing requirements. From these articles, we known that MoSCoW method has many benefits, but the requirements prioritization method not only have MoSCoW method. There are many different requirements prioritization method, such as AHP, 100$ and so on. When we chose a suitable method to prioritizing requirements, we need to consider both advantages and disadvantages of each method.

### Article 2: “An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software
 product release planning."

#### Motivation for selection:
This article is about interdependencies in requirements. In each release, it is a complex task to determine which requirements should be implemented. So there will be a viable product in each release plan, in order to ensure a viable product, it is important to determine the interdependence between given requirements before developing a release planning process. If we do not consider the dependencies between requirements, when part of requirements changed or new requirements injected, it will be produce a lot of problems that could lead our entire project failure. So, in order to understand how interdependency works between requirements and why this is that much important for release planning, I decide to select this article.
